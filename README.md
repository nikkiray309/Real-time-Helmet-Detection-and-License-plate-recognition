# Real-time-Helmet-Detection-and-License-plate-recognition

- There are a variety of traffic regulation issues in India, which can be addressed using various approaches. Riding a motorbike or scooter without a helmet is a traffic offence that has increased the number of accidents and deaths.

- The current system largely monitors traffic offences through CCTV records, in which traffic cops must zoom into the frame where the traffic violation is occurring and look at the license plate on the off chance that the rider isn't wearing a helmet. This will take a lot of labour and time.

- This project proposes a system that uses CNN to identify bike drivers who are not wearing helmets. The model is trained using TensorFlow techniques. The Model uses YOLO algorithm which employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect the non-Helmet riders.
